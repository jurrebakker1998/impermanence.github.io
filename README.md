*Impermanence*

_“Nothing is absolute. Everything changes, everything moves, everything revolves, everything flies and goes away.”_ -Frida Kahlo

This digital space is an audio visual experience made for the class 'Design by Machines' in 2025.
The game/experience is made in collaboration with an AI-Copilot, as this was the subjective of this class assignment.

The concept revolves around the idea of a digital meditative space. A non-space that represesnt a new era of designing. A collaboration between an AI and Human to generate digital work. 
The work can see as a starting point for a new language. A new way of contemporary digital design and interaction. 

Thanks for your time,
